Original data from  http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/
This dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 - July 2014.

This dataset includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs).

There is an updated version of this dataset, but I had trouble accessing it. It included reviews through 2018. 

The individual files are simplified version of the main dataset. These datasets include no metadata or reviews, but only (user,item,rating,timestamp) tuples. 
- 82,677,131 reviews from 21,176,522 users for 9,874,211 products. (seeing more reviews/product than reviews/user made me feel good about th labels on the dta being correctly ordered. They were not in the .csv itself, but were in the description of the dataset.)

To make this data more manageable on my machine (8gb RAM), I am creating a new version without the timestamp or user columns. I only need item and rating for my project. The file is called 'amzn_all_items_simplified.csv', this will be the working version of the raw data.
