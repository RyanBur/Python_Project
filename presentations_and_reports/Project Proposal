Project Proposal:

The Problem: How do companies extract meaningful information from overall online customer review statistics for goods/services when reviews are so positively skewed and so biased to being strongly positive or strongly negative? It is well-known that a 3/5 average rating does not mean the good/service is 'average', it is likely to be one of the lower-rated goods/services on th review site.

The Solution: Investigate the typical online reviews distribution for a good/service. Once it is known what a 'bad', 'normal', and 'exceptional' review distribution for a good/serivce looks like, the distribution for any individual good/service can be compared to the universe online-reviewed goods/services to determine whether ustomrs ar more or less satisfied than with an average good/service.



Background:
-Online reviews exhibit high levels of polarity and imbalance
-Characterized by J-shaped distributions
-Prior research has focused on overall review distribution characteristics for a review source (website)
