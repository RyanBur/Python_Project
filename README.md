# Python_Project
Project #1 for NYC Data Science Academy, focused on data analysis in Python


The files for this project fall into one of several sections. 

There are data files, which are not uploaded to GitHub but are described in the amazon_data_dictionary.txt file in folder rough_data\amazon_dataset.

There are files that were used for data inspection and transformation:
-"amazon_jupyter_data_inspection.ipynb"
-"amazon_data_inspection_2.ipynb"
-"amazon_full_data_transformation.ipynb"

Then there are files used in the data analysis portion of the project:
-"amazon_data_analysis.ipynb": Analysis of average product ratings distribution
-"amazon_reviews_cutoff_analysis.ipynb": Random sampling for establishing a condifence interval

And then there is the script for the final tool associated with this project:
--"Amazon_Review_Tool.py": Final product of this project, Python program using my analysis.

There is also a powerpoint that used as part of a presentation given during the NYC DSA program.
-"Extracting Insights from Amazon.pptx": Final presentation of project

To get a description of the project itself, the best reference would be the powerpoint presentation.
